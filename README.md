# Stochastic Processes
  This repository contains my studies and implementations related to stochastic processes. It includes:

# Statistical Foundations
  A detailed review of essential statistics, laying the groundwork for understanding stochastic processes.

# Stochastic Processes
  ## Poisson Processes: Modeling random events over time.
  ## Gaussian Processes: Non-parametric models for regression and classification.
  ## Synchronous Processes: Exploration of sync processes in time-series.
  ## Gauss-Markov Processes: Processes with Gaussian and Markovian properties.

# Markov Models
  ## Markov Chains: Discrete-time stochastic processes with memoryless property.
  ## Hidden Markov Models (HMMs): Models for systems with unobserved (hidden) states.

# Sampling Methods
  Techniques for sampling from stochastic processes and probability distributions.
